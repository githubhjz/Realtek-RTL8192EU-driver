Driver for Realtek chipset RTL8192EU: how-to install

1. Download the driver package Realtek-RTL8192EU-driver.tar.gz into the folder Downloads.

2. First unpack it in the terminal, because it's a compressed folder with files. In the terminal (use copy/paste):
cd Downloads && tar xvzf ~/Downloads/Realtek*.tar.gz

3. Now go to the uncompressed folder: in the terminal (use copy/paste):
cd install_folder

4. Finally: the actual installation. In the terminal (use copy/paste):
sudo ./install.sh

5. Plug the wireless dongle with the Realtek chipset into you computer: it should be functional now.
